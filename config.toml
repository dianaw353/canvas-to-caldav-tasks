# How class assignments, labs, quizzes, and exams are identified and tagged:
#
# 1. Automatic Course Tagging:
#    If an item's summary contains a pattern like "[COURSE-ID-SECTION Course Name]"
#    (e.g., "[HIST-1700-07 American History]"), it will be automatically
#    categorized as an assignment/task and tagged with the "COURSE-ID" (e.g., "HIST-1700").
#    This takes precedence over the keywords below for initial categorization,
#    unless it's a "no class" event.
#
# 2. Automatic Assignment Type Tagging:
#    For items identified as assignments, an additional tag will be applied
#    based on keywords in their summary (e.g., "Practical", "Exam", "Lab").
#    If no specific type keyword is found, it will default to "Assignment".
#    You can customize these keywords in the `canvas.py` file under `ASSIGNMENT_TYPE_KEYWORDS`.

# Keywords in UID to identify additional assignments (case-insensitive)
# Events with these words in the UID become tasks. (Lower precedence than course ID pattern).
assignment_keywords = ["assignment"]

# Keywords in summary to identify additional assignments (case-insensitive)
# Events with these words in the summary become tasks. (Lowest precedence).
